Backtracking is a refinement of the brute-force approach, which systematically searches for a solutions to a problem among all available
options.

In which scenarios it can used ?
When there is a set of options available at each step, and we must choose one from these. After a choice is made, there is a new set of
options for the next step. This procedure is repeated over and over until we reach a final state.

How to visualize it?
Tree structure. 

What can I done?
Dynamic programming if the nodes of the tree are same or same nodes are going to be visited everytime.
