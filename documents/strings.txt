String poblems:

If the question ask you to pick set of strings from the given string.

GO FOR GREEDY. This might help u. [If there are less restrictions]

Approaches:
1. Get freq dictinary
The last index of the character might help you. [check remove duplicates letters python file]
sort the indexes of the string by characters in ascending order

example:

a d a e f a c d b c d  e
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

pos = [0,2,5,8,6,9,1,10,3,11] arranged in asc of string.

2. Try to use hash set ... This might help you. 

3. Sort the string if needed.
And store the index as value and each_word/char as key and form a dict. [used: grouping anagrams]
