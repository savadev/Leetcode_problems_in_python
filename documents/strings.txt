String poblems:

If the question ask you to pick set of strings from the given string.

GO FOR GREEDY. This might help u. [If there are less restrictions]

Approaches:
1. Get freq dictinary
The last index of the character might help you. [check remove duplicates letters python file]
sort the indexes of the string by characters in ascending order

example:

a d a e f a c d b c d  e
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

pos = [0,2,5,8,6,9,1,10,3,11] arranged in asc of string.

2. Try to use hash set ... This might help you. 

3. Sort the string if needed.
And store the index as value and each_word/char as key and form a dict. [used: grouping anagrams]


===========================
When you want to fix one character in the string and do operations on rest of the characters then 
use recursion inside the loop

while start <= end:
  # do operation
  fix the character and send the rest of the charactersd
  recursice_call(array, start_+1, end) // now start index is fixed
  # do operation

===================================

Try to convert a word into a unique number if there is a problem where more number of words are to be processed.

How to convert each word in a list to a unique number?
Example: abcxyz 11100000000000000000000111 [26 size a - 0, b - 1, z - 25]
the above binary to decimal would give a unique decimal value

This will help a lot
